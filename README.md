# Pomodoro App
> Recapping Angular by trying to transform my old Tic-Tac-Toe into a Pomodoro =D 
>> ## Features
>>
## Core Features:

- A customizable Pomodoro timer for work/break intervals. [ ]
- Task list integration to track what you're working on. [ ]
- Visual progress indicators (e.g., progress bars or status updates). [ ]

> **Interesting to look into in the future (?) :**
- Add **gamification** elements. [ ]
- Save **session history** using *local storage* or **backend** (Firebase) integration - as a local + web app.
- Add animations for the transitions between the states (and stuff).

## Tech Stack
- **Angular**: Framework for building the app.  
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed JavaScript for better structure and reliability.  
- **HTML/CSS**: For the UI.  
- **Node.js & npm**: Dependency management and build tools.  

## Setup & Installation

- Clone the Repo:

```
git clone <your-repo-link>
```

- Then move into the /app directory! (typically `/your-repo/src/app`)

## Install Dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Run the App:

```
ng serve
```

- Open [Local host 4200](http://localhost:4200) in your browser to see the app in action.

## How I See it Working

- Set a timer countdown for your productive intervals and pauses.
- Add tasks to your task list and track them during work sessions.
- Use the timer to stay focused and productive.

## Planned Features

### Hereâ€™s what I coult try implementing as I continue building:

- Settings Menu: Customize timer durations and notifications. (Starting With Simple 3 Timer Varieties in Minutes)
- Progress Tracking: A dashboard to track completed work sessions.
- Dark Mode: For night owls. ðŸŒ™ 
- ? (idk about this one tbh) Mobile Responsiveness: So it works great on phones/tablets.

## Why I'm rebuilding it from my old project? 

- Because I like picking apart code much more than building it from scratch. ~
